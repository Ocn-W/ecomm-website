#E-commerce Website

## Mock online Shopping Website

This website is powered by Vite + React and explores the core functions needed to build an E-commerce site purely on the frontend.

## User Guide

This site serves as a mock-up for a typical e-commerce website with simple features such as:

- Randomly generated item list to select your desired purchase from
- Filtering items on the clothing page by price or rating
- Adding/Removing items from your favorites or shopping cart
- A checkout page with mock validation form to handle purchases

There is **no** backend for this site so certain buttons do not have functionality as it is outside of the scope of the intent for this website.

## Known Issues/Contributions

Currently working on mobile responsiveness!

## Major Takeaways

This website was my first major test with both Jotai and React Router and moving forward I will be using Jotai and the global state system of passing atoms over Redux store system.

## Final Notes

I am always looking for opportunies and collaborations with other developers or artist at any level so please reach out and [lets work](mailto:ocean.wrng@gmail.com) on some stuff!
